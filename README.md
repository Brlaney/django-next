# Quick Start

### 1. Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Brlaney/django-next.git
```

### 2. Setup the backend **Dj-api**

```
cd dj-api

# Activate a virtual environment
virtualenv ll_env
ll_env\scripts\activate.bat

# Download necessary packages
py -m pip install Django djangorestframework django-cors-headers

# Make database migrations
py manage.py makemigrations
py manage.py migrate 

# Create admin superuser
py manage.py createsuperuser
..<input a username, email, and password>

# Populate your database with initial data from the dj-api/api/fixtures directory
py manage.py loaddata fixture
```

The terminal should output: `Installed 30 object(s) from 1 fixture(s)`.
If an error message appears then run `py manage.py migrate --run-syncdb`
and `py manage.py migrate` first and then `py manage.py loaddata fixture` should work.

### 3. Confirm your backend is functioning

```
py manage.py runserver
```

Now navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
and confirm the initial data was loaded properly.

### 4. Setup the frontend **next-app**

Open up another terminal (tab or window) and keep your backend running.

```
# In the new terminal cd into the next-app directory
cd next-app

# Install all dependencies
yarn install 

# or if using npm
npm install

# Create a .env.local file with backend api endpoint inside
echo > .env.local

# In your text editor put the following line in your .env.local file
DJANGO_API=http://localhost:8000/api

# Start your frontend app
yarn dev

# or
npm run dev
```
